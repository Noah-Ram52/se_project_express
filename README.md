# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The back-end focuses on the databases for the server such as working with the current databases, security set up and testing, and deploying current web applications to a remote machine. It also uses API and user authorization throughout this project.

## Testing the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
